A re-implementation of [Testcontainer Selenium/WebDriver](https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/webdriver_containers/) with the following improvements:
* It uses [Selenium's video recorder](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/blob/trunk/README.md#video-recording)
  * Doesn't require VNC 
    * No VNC Server started in the browser container (unless explicitly stated) â†’ Saves memory
  * Uses [Selenium's implementation](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/Video) and isn't [based](https://github.com/testcontainers/vnc-recorder) on [some python code from 2010](https://pypi.org/project/vnc2flv/#history)
    * Way more customization options for e.g. ``framerate``, ``codec``, ``preset`` ...
    * Uses ``mp4`` as default recording format (wider support in comparison to ``flv``)
    * [Renders while saving the video](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/blob/4c572afd1173b5bd49fa2def3b54ea552fccee85/Video/video.sh#L126) (not when finished which takes additional time)
  * Stops the recorder before saving the file so that there is no way that [it runs forever](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/discussions/6229).
* Automatically tries to select a alternative Selenium version for the docker image if it [doesn't exist](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/1979).
* Added support for [NoVNC](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/blob/trunk/README.md#using-your-browser-no-vnc-client-is-needed) so that no dedicated VNC client is required
* Improve creation of video filenames
* Removed hard dependency on Selenium-Java.<br/>Only required when using ``CapabilitiesBrowserWebDriverContainer``
* Everything can be ``@Override``n if required
* Caches "Selenium version detection via classpath" so that it's not invoked everytime you build a new container
